<ul>The Department of Homeless Services (DHS) and The Neighborhood Association for Inter-Cultural Affairs (NAICA) are operating a male-only homeless assistance facility at the Ibis Styles Hotel near LaGuardia Airport.
The facility originally operated at the Marriott Hotel but moved in July of this year.
At the facility, there are 172 clients and 86 rooms. The population is considered a general population of male individuals who are actively looking for employment or in need of transitional housing.</ul>

  <ul>Living in New York can be expensive. NAICA along with DHS have initiated plans to assist individuals in need of housing. In doing so, providers work with each individual to secure a voucher. Following their stay at the shelter, individuals who exit the shelter system will be eligible for a housing voucher that would then pay a portion of their rent. Although the voucher would not provide full rent assistance, it is intended to alleviate the burden of rent in the New York area. This means that individuals would be responsible for the remaining amount of rent. In order to qualify for the voucher, individuals would need to have an open public assistance case and would also have to continously work with their caseworkers to prove that they are eligible, making money and saving money. The program is intended to give individuals the jumpstart on their lives without the fear of being by themselves. The voucher would be valid as long as the individuals needs assistance and prove that housing is a burden on their lives.</ul>

    <ul>NAICA and DHS have 80 facilities that are similar in nature throughout the boroughs of New York. The facility at the Ibis Hotel will be the first of its kind in the Queens. In addition to providing resources for male individuals in need, the facility is also working with local organizations in the immediate area. In doing so, the site is able to provide an array of services that include services such as — substance abuse, alcohol abuse, mental health and general healthcare. The facility is working to establish this connection with Urban Health and the Family Health Center in Corona. In addition, NAICA is working with Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens and Brightpoint Health services to provide substance and mental health counseling. Currently, NAICA is working to connect with more local organizations. "If there are any other programs that could be beneficial for our residents, please share them with us. We are open to ideas and suggestions, and no one knows their community better than you guys," Ricardo Cosme Ruiz, Executive Director of Intergovernmental and Community Affairs for NAICA, said.</ul>
